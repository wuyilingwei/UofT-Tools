## Technical Overview

- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + Vite multi-page app, isolated under `web/` (page entries + `web/src/`), deployed to Cloudflare (Workers static assets)
- **Backend**: Python web scrapers (Playwright + BeautifulSoup), organised by module under `scripts/{calendar,planner,common}/`, run on a schedule via GitHub Actions
- **Data**: scraper-generated `*.ics` / planner JSON live in `data/` (separate from the web sources). `npm run build` runs `vite build` then `copy-data.mjs`, which copies `data/` into `dist/` so the deployed paths (`/calendar/*.ics`, `/planner/data/*.json`) are unchanged
- **Deployment**: `dist/` is the publish directory (`wrangler deploy`); `npm run deploy` builds + deploys
- **Updates**: Automatic calendar sync every 24 hours

### Layout

```
web/        Vue 3 + Vite app (index/faq/statement/calendar/planner entries + src/)
data/       scraper output — calendar/*.ics, planner/data/*.json (copied into dist/ at build)
scripts/    Python scrapers — calendar/ planner/ common/
dist/       build output (gitignored): vite build + copied data/
```

### Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev                       # Vite dev server (web/ app)
npm run build                     # vite build → dist/, then copy data/ → dist/
npm run preview                   # serve dist/ with data (full local test)
npm test                          # Vitest unit + component tests
```

> Note: `npm run dev` serves the app only; the scraper data in `data/` is copied
> in at build time, so use `npm run build && npm run preview` to test with live data.
